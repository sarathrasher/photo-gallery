# Photo Gallery 
---------------------
This interactive photo gallery utilizes JavaScript to populate the page dynamically as opposed to hardcoding each image in HTML. Modal functionality allows the user to see a larger image when clicked.
All pictures included are of my own personal craft projects.

## Technologies Used 
--------------------
HTML, CSS, Flexbox, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Getting Started
------------------
To view the live demo, go to: https://smuntean.github.io/photo-gallery/


Clicking on an image will bring up a modal that highlights the picture. Use the arrow keys or the arrow buttons to scroll through pictures. When you want to exit the modal, click anywhere on the background of the screen, or on the 'X' button.
